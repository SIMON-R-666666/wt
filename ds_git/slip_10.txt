Q.2 A) Write a python program to Display column-wise mean, and median for SOCR
HeightWeight dataset. 

import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file
file_path = (r'C:\Users\chaitanya jadhav\Desktop\chaitanya jadhav java\height.weight1.csv')
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows to understand the dataset
print("First few rows of the dataset:")
print(df.head())

# Calculate mean and median column-wise
mean_values = df.mean()
median_values = df.median()

# Display the results
print("\nColumn-wise Mean:")
print(mean_values)

print("\nColumn-wise Median:")
print(median_values)





#Q.2 B) Write a python program to compute sum of Manhattan distance between all pairs of points. 
def manhattan_distance(point1, point2):
    return abs(point1[0] - point2[0]) + abs(point1[1] - point2[1]) 
def sum_manhattan_distances(points):
    total_distance = 0 
    n = len(points) 
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            total_distance += manhattan_distance(points[i], points[j]) 
            return total_distance 
points = [(1, 2), (4, 6), (3, 8), (7, 1)] 
total_distance = sum_manhattan_distances(points) 
print("Sum of Manhattan distances between all pairs of points:", total_distance)
